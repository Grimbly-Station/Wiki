* **Space Law** is a broad set of rules and regulations, collected and regulated by TerraGov, enacted and enforced by NanoTrasen and its Station Security, with the oversight of CentCom - and, on occasion, TerraGov's Galactic Police Force. Space Law applies to all ranks and positions on stations under its jurisdiction, from the lowliest Passenger to the highest Captain; all are equal under the eyes of the Law, and all must ultimately answer to it.

It is highly recommended to read the Standard Operating Procedures, but specifically the following parts:
* Jurisdiction
* Pressing Charges
* Sentencing
* Trial Procedures
* Treatment of Prisoners
* Paroles and Pardons
* Synthetics and Sophonts
* Crime Codes Quick Reference
## Sentences
### Capital Sentences
* **Execution**: Termination of the convict’s life.
    * Whenever any execution is performed, regardless of trial or not, a general announcement must be made detailing who was executed and for what reason.
    * The convict may select from one of four methods of execution, depending on availability: firing squad, lethal injection, electric shock, or asphyxiation. If the convict does not make a choice after being given ample opportunity, the sentencing officer or other relevant authority may select the method that is most appropriate. Convicts may request alternate methods of execution that may be approved or denied at the discretion of the individual passing the sentence.
    * The executed’s corpse must be burned, stored in the morgue, or processed by medical staff using the biomass reclaimer.
* **Exfiltration**: Immediate retrieval of the convict via a CentComm, or GALPOL, dispatched transport.
    * The prisoner may be held in a temporary cell until the transport arrives.
    * If a transport cannot be arranged, default to other capital sentences.
* **Preservative Stasis**: Relocation of the convict into a morgue or similar controlled and regulated environment until one’s sentence is concluded or the legal system can accommodate the convict.
* **Decorporealisation**: Stripping the convict’s mind from their body into a more restricting form.
    * Soul crystals, golems, and cyborgs are all permissible forms.
* **Permanent Brig, Permabrig, or Extended Confinement**: Placing the convict into the permanent brig until the end of the shift, where they are to be transported to Central Command for processing.
    * The convict has the same rights as any other prisoner within the permabrig, whether they arrived by transport or were sentenced to Extended confinement.

### Standard Sentences
* **Brigging**: Placing the convict into a temporary holding cell. See Treatment of Prisoners (SOP).
* **Catch & Release**: Taking the convict to Security, processing them, searching them, and then releasing them. See Jurisdiction (SOP).
* **Demotion**: Downgrading the convict’s employment contract and revoking their access accordingly, with permission from or when ordered by the convict’s head of department. May be applied when the convict has committed a crime relating to their employment within their department or with NanoTrasen as a whole. See Conduct Unbecoming (Company Policy).
* **Licence restriction**: Downgrading or suspending the convict’s armament licence and confiscating possessions accordingly. May be applied when the convict is guilty of possession or a crime involving a weapon they were lawfully permitted to carry.
