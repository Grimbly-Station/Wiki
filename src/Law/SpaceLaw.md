    **Space Law** is a broad set of rules and regulations, collected and regulated by TerraGov, enacted and enforced by NanoTrasen and its Station Security, with the oversight of CentCom - and, on occasion, TerraGov's Galactic Police Force. Space Law applies to all ranks and positions on stations under its jurisdiction, from the lowliest Passenger to the highest Captain; all are equal under the eyes of the Law, and all must ultimately answer to it.

It is highly recommended to read the Standard Operating Procedures and specifically the following parts:

- Jurisdiction
- Pressing Charges
- Sentencing
- Trial Procedures
- Treatment of Prisoners
- Paroles and Pardons
- Synthetics and Sophonts
- Crime Codes Quick Reference
